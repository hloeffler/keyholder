== NAME

keyholder-auth - ssh key authorizations for keyholder's ssh-agent-proxy.

== DESCRIPTION

Keyholder authorizes users based on unix group membership. To give a certain
group of users access to one or more of the keyholder-managed ssh keys, you must
create an authorization yaml file in */etc/keyholder-auth.d/*. An authorization
file should contain a top level map with unix group names as keys, each mapped
to a list of the ssh keys which that group is allowed to use.

For each ssh key name you must create a ssh private key *[key-name]* and
corresponding public key *[key-name].pub* in */etc/keyholder.d/[key-name]*.

IMPORTANT: Key files should be readable only by the keyholder daemon's uid.

== EXAMPLE
.groups.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
# map unix groups to ssh keys in /etc/keyholder.d:
---
users: [users-key]
admins: [users-key, admins-key]
